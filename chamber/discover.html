                <h2>Historical Shrine</h2>
                <p>
                    The Ise Grand Shrine, or Ise Jingu, located in the heart of a sacred forest in the Mie Prefecture of Japan, is the most important Shinto shrine in the country.  It was first built in 4 BCE, and the present-day structures are based on the buildings erected in the 7th century CE.  The complex, as well as the Uju bridge and torii gateway, are rebuilt every 20 years.  The last renovation was in 2013.  Ise Jingu is the ancestral shrine of the emperors of Japan.

                <h2>Meat Lover</h2>
                <p>
                    When you visit Mie don't miss eating the Matsusaka beef.
                    Matsusaka beef is a brand of beef as famous as Kobe beef.
                    As the good cow with a selected pedigree is raised slowly over a long time, the marbling of the beef becomes so fine that it is called ‚Äúthe art of meat‚Äù.
                    The beautifully carved line of the marbled beef will make your heart pound.
                    We recommend you eat them as a "steak" or Sukiyaki so that you can enjoy the smell of the meat.
